React Tutorial by Akshay Saini

Episode 1:
  - hello world in HTML -> JS -> React (via cdn)
  React createElement, ReactDOM createRoot -> returns react objects
  render() processes these objects & returns html understandable by browser

Episode 2: npm, React (npm), Parcel
  - tree shaking
  - local server
  - dev build
  - HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
  - File Watching Algorithm
  - Caching (faster builds)
  - Image optimization
  - Minification
  - Bundling
  - Compress
  - consistent hashing
  - code splitting
  - Differentiate building (Support for older browsers)
  - HTTPS server
  - etc etc

Episode 3:
  - part 1: scripts to start dev server, build prod
    npx parcel index.html = npm run start = npm start (start is reserved word)
    npx parcel build index.html == npm run build != npm build
  - part 2: render() function
  - part 3:
      - JSX (HTML like syntax, but not html in JS), different from React.
      - return from createElement same as JSX statement
      - Redo Episode 1 using JSX
      - babel converts(transpiles) JSX code to React's create component
  - part 4:
    - React Element vs component
    - React Components: ClassBased (old) & Functional Components (new)
    - Function Components: Returns JSX
    - Redo Episode 1 using React Component
    - Component Composition (component inside component)
  - part 5:
    - JS inside JSX (JS Expressions)
    - React Element inside React Element
    - React Element inside React Component
    - React Component inside React Component
    - React Component inside React Element
    - JSX handles XSS (Cross Site Scripting), by sanitizing the data passed to JSX, i.e. within {}
    - ALl below are similar Inside JSX
      const Title = () => (
        <h1 id="heading">Hello world</h1>
      )
      - {Title()}
      - <Title />
      - <Title></Title>
